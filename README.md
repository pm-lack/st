## Installation for newbs

You should have xlib header files and libharfbuzz build files installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st
cd st
sudo make install
```

### Colors

To be clear about the color settings:

- This build will use gruvbox colors by default and as a fallback.
- If there are Xresources colors defined, those will take priority.
- But if `wal` has run in your session, its colors will take priority.

Note that when you run `wal`, it will negate the transparency of existing windows, but new windows will continue with the previously defined transparency.
